## 1NF-First Normal Form
We say a relation is in 1NF if all values stored in the relation are single-valued and atomic. 
1NF places restrictions on the structure of relations. Values must be simple.
## BCNF-Boyce-Codd Normal Form
a relation is in BCNF if it is in 1NF and if every determinant is a candidate key.
## 2NF-Second Normal Form
A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF, and every non-key attribute is fully dependent on each candidate key. 
## 3NF-Third Normal Form
A relation is in 3NF if the relation is in 1NF and all determinants of non-key attributes are candidate keys
