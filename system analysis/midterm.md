## 1. THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)
### 1.1 The object
* Moves systematically through phases where each phase has a standard set of outputs
* Produces project deliverables
* Uses deliverables in implementation
* Results in actual information system
* Uses gradual refinement

### 1.2 The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of four stages: 
Planning, Analysis, Design, and Implementation
### 1.3 The Major Development Methodologies: 
* Structured Design
  * Waterfall Method
  * Parallel Development
* Rapid Application Development (RAD)
  * Phased Development
  * Prototyping (system prototyping)
  * Throwaway Prototyping (design prototyping) 
* Agile development
  * eXtreme Programming

## 2. Requirements Gathering Methods
* Interviews
* JAD Sessions
* Questionnaires
* Document Analysis
* Observation

## 3. Types of Questions
###  Closed-Ended Questions
Specific and precise:How do customers place orders?
What additional informationwould you like the new systemto provide?

### Open-Ended Questions
Unravel more info,Gives more control:What do you think about the current system?

### Probing Questions
Follow up for what is left:Why?Can you give me an example?Can you explain that in a bit 
      more detail?
## 4. Joint Application Development (JAD)
Joint application development (or JAD as it is more commonly known) is an information
gathering technique that allows the project team, users, and management to
work together to identify requirements for the system.  JAD can reduce scope creep by 50%,
and it prevents the requirements for a system from being too specific or too vague,
both of which can cause trouble during later stages of the SDLC. JAD is a structured
process in which 10 to 20 users meet under the direction of a facilitator skilled
in JAD techniques. The facilitator is a person who sets the meeting agenda and
guides the discussion, but does not join in the discussion as a participant. He or
she does not provide ideas or opinions on the topics under discussion and remains
neutral during the session. The facilitator must be an expert in both group process
techniques and systems analysis and design techniques. One or two scribes assist the
facilitator by recording notes, making copies, and so on. Often, the scribes will use
computers and CASE tools to record information as the JAD session proceeds.
The JAD group meets for several hours, several days, or several weeks until all
of the issues have been discussed and the needed information is collected.

## 5. JAD sessions:some common problems and some ways to deal with them
### Reducing domination
The facilitator should ensure that
no one person dominates the group discussion. The
only way to deal with someone who dominates is head
on. During a break, approach the person, thank him
or her for their insightful comments, and ask them to
help you make sure that others also participate.
### Encouraging noncontributors
Drawing out people who have participated very little is challenging
because you want to bring them into the conversation
so that they will contribute again. The best approach is
to ask a direct factual question that you are certain
they can answer. And it helps to ask the question using
some repetition to give them time to think. For example
“Pat, I know you’ve worked shipping orders a long
time. You’ve probably been in the Shipping Department
longer than anyone else. Could you help us
understand exactly what happens when an order is
received in Shipping?”
### Side discussions
Sometimes participants engage in
side conversations and fail to pay attention to the
group. The easiest solution is simply to walk close to
the people and continue to facilitate right in front of
them. Few people will continue a side conversion
when you are two feet from them and the entire
group’s attention is on you and them.
### Agenda merry-go-round
The merry-go-round occurs when a group member keeps returning to the same
issue every few minutes and won’t let go. One solution
is to let the person have five minutes to ramble on
about the issue while you carefully write down every
point on a flip chart or computer file. This flip chart or
file is then posted conspicuously on the wall. When the
person brings up the issue again, you interrupt them,
walk to the paper and ask them what to add. If they
mention something already on the list, you quickly
interrupt, point out that it is there, and ask what other
information to add. Don’t let them repeat the same
point, but write any new information.
### Violent agreement
Some of the worst disagreements occur when participants really agree on the issues but
don’t realize that they agree because they are using different
terms. An example is arguing whether a glass is
half empty or half full; they agree on the facts, but can’t
agree on the words. In this case, the facilitator has to
translate the terms into different words and find common
ground so the parties recognize that they really agree.
### Unresolved conflict
In some cases, participants don’t agree and can’t understand how to determine what alternatives
are better. You can help by structuring the issue.
Ask for criteria by which the group will identify a good
alternative (e.g., “Suppose this idea really did improve
customer service. How would I recognize the improved
customer service?”). Then once you have a list of criteria,
ask the group to assess the alternatives using them.
### True conflict
Sometimes, despite every attempt, participants
just can’t agree on an issue. The solution is to
postpone the discussion and move on. Document the
issue as an “open issue” and list it prominently on a
flip chart. Have the group return to the issue hours
later. Often the issue will resolve itself by then and you
haven’t wasted time on it. If the issue cannot be
resolved later, move it to the list of issues to be decided
by the project sponsor or some other more senior member
of management.
### Use humor
Humor is one of the most powerful tools a
facilitator has and thus must be used judiciously. The
best JAD humor is always in context; never tell jokes but
take the opportunity to find the humor in the situation.
